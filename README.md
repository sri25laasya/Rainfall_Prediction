# Rainfall_Prediction


We have used Random Forest Regression.
The Reasons being:

a)Handles Non-Linear Relationships: Rainfall prediction is a complex problem that involves non-linear relationships between various factors such as temperature, humidity, and pressure. Random Forest Regressor is able to capture these non-linear relationships better than linear regression models.

b)Robust to Outliers: Rainfall data may contain outliers due to sudden changes in weather conditions. Random Forest Regressor is robust to outliers and able to handle noisy data.

c)Handles Missing Data: Rainfall data may also have missing values due to weather station failures or other reasons. Random Forest Regressor can handle missing data by using other available features to make predictions.

d)Provides Feature Importance: Random Forest Regressor can provide a measure of feature importance, which can help in understanding which variables are most important for rainfall prediction.

e)Good for Large Datasets: Rainfall prediction models may require large datasets with many features. Random Forest Regressor is able to handle large datasets efficiently and can work well with a large number of input features.
